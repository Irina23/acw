            <h1>Working from home? Here’s how to stay on task</h1>
            <div class="data">Apr, 08 2016</div>
            <div class="img-holder"><img src="img/content/article_img.jpg"></div>
            <p>I’ve been working remotely as a freelancer or contractor for two years now. I also have ADHD, and I am a terrible procrastinator. As a result, I’ve spent the past two years developing a system that helps me get my work done and be a good teammate in the process.<br>Whether you work remotely as a full-time employee or you freelance, the major struggles of staying on task usually come down to time management. An office has a natural structure and system. When working from home, you’re left to your own devices. And if I don’t follow my own system, I fail miserably.<br>I’ve found that creating structure is the best way to approach the difficulties of remote work (and to wrangle the double-headed monster of ADHD and procrastination in the process). By creating systems and routines for how to structure my time, I’ve been able to replicate, to an extent, the kind of structure that comes naturally when working in an office.</p>
            <h3>Start with a strategy</h3>
            <p>“Tactics are idiosyncratic,” Seth Godin says. “But strategies are universal, and there are a lot of talented folks who are not succeeding the way they want to because their strategies are broken.” While productivity tactics are helpful, they aren’t universal. And they aren’t necessarily that helpful unless I place them within a larger strategy of structure and routine. Because the difficulty of working from home, I think, is the bigger picture: the overwhelmingness of it all.<br>The hardest part of my endless freedom is just that, the freedom. Freedom is amazing. But it can quickly become overwhelming. While the work itself is defined, the way you go about it is not. There is no one checking up on your progress, no coworkers sitting nearby who might silently judge you for being on Facebook. It’s just you, your computer, and a deadline. When at the office, you can’t leave to run errands (or you can, but not regularly). You can’t do your laundry or clean the kitchen. Working from home offers all sorts of distractions that just aren’t available at the office.<br>Many people suggest working at a coffee shop, library, or coworking space. Or any other place where, when you’re there, it’s time to work. I prefer to work at home, so I am left with a desk in my bedroom, and my structure—the only tools I have to be productive.<br>Establishing a routine has been crucial. Each day can be vastly different as a natural result of All The Freedom. So I’ve developed a routine and I try my best to stick to it.<br>Everyone’s routine will be different. There are so many articles out there advocating specific tactics routines that successful entrepreneurs follow. What it comes down to is what works best for you. Over the years I’ve tried various methods, picking up bits and pieces that work for me, never hesitating to throw the rest out of the window. I will never wake up at 6am and go for a run and not check email until 10pm. I am not that person. And that’s okay.<br>The point is: I listen to myself. And I try to understand what makes me happier and more productive. That’s all there is to it.</p>
            <p>Usually around 1pm my attention starts to dwindle. When I last worked in an office, we had a workout room, so during this time I’d often go lift some weights for half an hour, and then shower. I’d get back to my desk and feel energized, ready to finish out the rest of the day. This is a luxury that most people who work in an office don’t have, but lucky for us remote workers, we have All The Freedom to take a break in the middle of the work day.<br>There are tons of benefits to taking a quick break: they refresh our energy, stave off boredom, and help us refocus on the bigger picture. Most people suggest working out, taking a walk, or even napping. I often use a lull in attention as a cue to make lunch and eat while reading a book that’s unrelated to my work.<br>Remember, though, that your break should be just that, a break. I’ve learned over my time working remotely that there are some breaks I will never come back from. This is where All The Freedom can be a burden. Theoretically, I can galavant off to wherever my heart desires. It’s tempting, especially on days when I’m frustrated or bored. So that’s something I keep in mind when choosing a break activity. If it’s too fun, or too tiring, I might not get back to work.</p>
